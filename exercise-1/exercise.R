# Exercise 1: Lists

# Create a vector of everything you ate for breakfast
breakfast <- c("eggs", "sausages", "juice")

# Create a vector of everything you ate for lunch
lunch <- c("sandwich", "salad", "apple")

# Create a list "meals" that has contains your `breakfast` and `lunch`
meals <- list(my.breakfast = breakfast, my.lunch = lunch)

# Add a "dinner" element to your "meals" list that has what you plan to eat for dinner
meals$my.dinner <- c("lamb", "onions", "carrots")
print(meals)

# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
dinner <- meals$my.dinner

# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason)
meals[[5]] <- meals[['my.lunch']]

# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early.meals`
early.meals <- meals[1:2]


### Bonus ###
# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function
items <- lapply(meals, length)

# Write a function that adds pizza to every meal
AddPizza <- function(meal) {
  x <- c(meal, "pizza")
}

# Add pizza to every meal!
new.meals <- lapply(meals, AddPizza)
print(new.meals)
